# when-is-it-out
A Django web app that keeps track of updates to events I follow.

Someone should make a website to track updates for our favourite shows, movies and games.
The goal is to quickly look up whatever we are following without sifting through dozens 
of clickbait articles, ad-ridden, bloated sites, and receive timely, spam-free notifications when there's
a major update.

Look up a topic, e.g. The Walking Dead, or submit it if it's not there, and see if other users have submitted when 
the next season is coming out. Submit any new information you have that others may not know, and subscribe to be notified when there's an update.
